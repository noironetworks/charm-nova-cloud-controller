maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
 addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
 EC2 API.
 .
 This charm provides the cloud controller service for OpenStack Nova and includes
 nova-scheduler, nova-api and nova-conductor services.

clear-unit-knownhost-cache:
  params:
    target:
      type: string
      default: ""
  description: |
    Clear the knownhost cache for (default) all the units, a service, or a
    single unit.
    .
    The default is all units.  If the 'target' param has an '/' in it, then it
    is assumed ot be a single unit.  If no '/' is present, then all the units
    in a service will be refreshed.
    .
    e.g. target="nova-compute/4" will just clear the nova-compute/4 unit (in
    the 'nova-compute' application), whereas target='nova-compute' will refresh
    all of the units in the 'nova-compute' application.
    .
    The action triggers a refresh resolution of the known hosts for the unit,
    which then populates the cache, updates the knownhosts file for the
    associated service (e.g. 'nova-compute'), and, importantly, sets the
    relation data for that associated service with the new knownhosts file.
    This may cause a 'cloud-compute' relation changed hook on the associated
    nova-compute units if the hosts have changed.
    .
    This action still functions even if the 'cache-known-hosts' config value is
    not set; caching of hosts occurs regardless of that setting, and so this
    action can be used to force an update if DNS has changed in the system, or
    for a particular host (although this scenario is unlikely).
sync-compute-availability-zones:
  description: |
    Update Nova host aggregates to match the availability zone defined in the
    related nova-compute units. This action will create any missing host
    aggregates in Nova and add hypervisors to the appropriate host aggregates.
    This action will not remove any hypervisors from host aggregates already
    configured in nova.
    .
    This action requires that the nova-cloud-controller application be fully
    related to keystone. This action will fail if the Nova API is unavailable.
    Successful completion of this action will report a list of each hypervisor
    added to an availability zone. Successful completion with no output means
    that all hypervisors were associated with their host aggregates.
    .
    This action is only available for OpenStack Stein and newer.

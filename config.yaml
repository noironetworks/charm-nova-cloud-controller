      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.

        FlatDHCPManager (nova-network) (default)
        FlatManager (nova-network)
        Neutron (Full SDN solution)
      .
      When using the Neutron option you will most likely want to use
      the neutron-gateway charm to provide L3 routing and DHCP Services.

  region:
    type: string
    default: RegionOne
    description: OpenStack Region
  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for internal
      communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports. Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Nova's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certificate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).
  ssl_key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: SSL key to use with certificate specified as ssl_cert.
  ssl_ca:
    type: string

  service-guard:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Ensure required relations are made and complete before allowing services
      to be started
      .
      By default, services may be up and accepting API request from install
      onwards.
      .
      Enabling this flag ensures that services will not be started until the
      minimum 'core relations' have been made between this charm and other
      charms.
      .
      For this charm the following relations must be made:
      .
        * shared-db
        * amqp
        * identity-service
  console-access-protocol:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Protocol to use when accessing virtual machine console. Supported types
      are None, spice, xvpvnc, novnc and vnc (for both xvpvnc and novnc).
  console-proxy-ip:
    type: string
    default: local
    description: |
      If console-access-protocol != None then this is the ip published to
      clients for access to console proxy. Set to local for the ip address of
      the nova-cloud-controller serving the request to be used.
  console-keymap:
    type: string
    default: 'en-us'
    description: |
      Console keymap.
  console-ssl-cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Used for encrypted console connections. This differs from the SSL
      certificate used for API endpoints and is used for console sessions only.
      Setting this value along with console-ssl-key will enable encrypted
      console sessions. This has nothing to do with Nova API SSL and can be
      used independently. This can be used in conjunction when
      console-access-protocol is set to 'novnc' or 'spice'.
  console-ssl-key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: SSL key to use with certificate specified as console-ssl-cert.
  enable-serial-console:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Enable serial console access to instances using websockets (insecure).
      This is only supported on OpenStack Juno or later, and will disable the
      normal console-log output for an instance.
  worker-multiplier:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      this service. By default, the number of workers for each daemon is
      set to twice the number of CPU cores a service unit has. When deployed
      in a LXD container, this default value will be capped to 4 workers
      unless this configuration option is set.
  cpu-allocation-ratio:
    type: float
    default: 16.0
    description: |
      The per physical core -> virtual core ratio to use in the Nova scheduler.
      .
      Increasing this value will increase instance density on compute nodes
      at the expense of instance performance.
  ram-allocation-ratio:
    type: float
    default: 1.5
    description: |
      The physical ram -> virtual ram ratio to use in the Nova scheduler.
      .
      Increasing this value will increase instance density on compute nodes
      at the potential expense of instance performance.
  disk-allocation-ratio:
    type: float
    default: 1.0
    description: |
      Increase the amount of disk space that nova can overcommit to guests.
      .
      Increasing this value will increase instance density on compute nodes
      with an increased risk of hypervisor storage becoming full.
  single-nova-consoleauth:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      When this configuration is set to True, a single instance of
      nova-consoleauth service will be running, this allows users to always
      authenticate against the same instance and avoid authentications issues
      when the token used was stored in a different instance.
      .
      If memcached is being used to store the tokens, then it's recommended to
      change this configuration to False.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  scheduler-default-filters:
    type: string
    default: "RetryFilter,AvailabilityZoneFilter,CoreFilter,RamFilter,ComputeFilter,ComputeCapabilitiesFilter,ImagePropertiesFilter,ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter,ServerGroupAffinityFilter"
    description: |
      List of filter class names to use for filtering hosts when not specified in
      the request.
  pci-alias:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The pci-passthrough-whitelist option of nova-compute charm is used for
      specifying which PCI devices are allowed passthrough. pci-alias is more
      a convenience that can be used in conjunction with Nova flavor properties
      to automatically assign required PCI devices to new instances. You could,
      for example, have a GPU flavor or a SR-IOV flavor:
      .
        pci-alias='{"vendor_id":"8086","product_id":"10ca","name":"a1"}'
      .
      This configures a new PCI alias 'a1' which will request a PCI device with
      a vendor id of 0x8086 and a product id of 10ca.
      .
      For more information about the syntax of pci_alias, refer to
      https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/compute/config-options.html

      file under the "filter:ratelimit" section as "limits".
      .
      The syntax for these rules is documented at:

  disable-aws-compat:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |

      for EC2 and S3 is configured, setting this option to `true` the services
      are stopped and disabled.

      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be

    default: "juju"
    description: |

      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
        juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.

      When compute hosts are configured with SRIOV NICs, setting
      this parameter to True allows users to select which SRIOV NIC

      pci_passthrough_whitelist map configured on compute hosts,
      along with the binding:profile physical_network attribute when
      creating the port for the NIC in neutron.
